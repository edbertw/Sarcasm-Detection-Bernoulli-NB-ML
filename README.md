# Sarcasm Detection using Bernoulli Naives Bayes ML Model
## About
Implemented a sarcasm detection algorithm using Machine Learning trained on a dataset of both sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines as well as the link to the news page. Implemented a count vectorizer for NLP tasks and text feature extraction and Bernoulli Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm to train the model to predict if an input text is sarcastic based on its vectorized features.
